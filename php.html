      <b>PHP</b> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web
      development.[8] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
      Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference
      implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally an
      abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for the
      recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14] PHP code is usually
      processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a
      daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server,
      the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type
      of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole
      or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
      management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to
      orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally,
      PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such
      as standalone graphical applications[15] and drone control.[16] PHP code
      can also be directly executed from the command line.
