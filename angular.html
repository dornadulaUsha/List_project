      <b>Angular</b> (also referred to as Angular 2+)[4] is a TypeScript-based
      free and open-source single-page web application framework. It is
      developed by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.

      Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million
      developers, library authors, and content creators.[5] According to the
