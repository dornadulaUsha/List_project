      <b>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS)</b> is a free and open-source
      front-end JavaScript library[5][6] that aims to make building user
      interfaces based on components more "seamless".[5] It is maintained by
      Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and
      companies.[7][8][9] React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
      server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js and Remix[a].
      Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering
      components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for
      routing and other client-side functionality.[11][12] A key advantage of
      React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have
      changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.
