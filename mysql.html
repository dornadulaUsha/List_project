      MySQL is an open-source relational database management system
      (RDBMS).[6][7] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder
      Michael Widenius's daughter My,[1] and "SQL", the acronym for Structured
      Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data
      tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help
      structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create,
      modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control
      user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL,
      an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a
      relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows
      for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation
      of backups. MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the
      GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of
      proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company
      MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle
      Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the
      open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]
